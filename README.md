# Sc2_Replay_Parser

This is a program which parses Starcraft 2 replays into a time-series data set.  I wrote this program as a project for the Fall 2024 offering of CPSC 4310 instructed by Wendy Osborn at the University of Lethbridge.  It is heavily based on the research paper "A Pattern Mining Approach to Study Strategy Balance in RTS Games" by Guillaume Bosc, Philip Tan, Jean-François Boulicaut, Chedy Raïssi, and Mehdi Kaytoue, and I make no claim of originality to the algorithms herein.
